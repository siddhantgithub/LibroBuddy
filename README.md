Libro Buddy
==============================

A book recommendation model that recommends books based on a user's personality. The model is built by utilizing the following technologies:

a) Pytorch 
b) Sklearn
c) HuggingFace Transformers

## Problem
Recommendation system (especially collaborative filtering based) have the problem of cold start or in other words 

## Solution
Use user’s personality type to provide book recommendation. 

Overall Flow:

- Developed a recommendation model based on collaborative filtering using PyTorch. Amazon book review dataset is used for the recommendation engine
- Used Book Embeddings (latest parameters) to cluster books using K-means clustering
- Generated each cluster's big-five personality type using a Hugging Face transformer model
- Used a HuggingFace transformer model to assess a user's big-five personality from 3 - 4 line user bio
- Matched user's big-five personality to the book clusters and provided top rated books from the cluster that closely matched
